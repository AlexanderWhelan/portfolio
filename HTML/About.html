    <div class="about">
    <p>My name is Alexander Whelan, and I’m a student at Cambridge Rindge and Latin High School in Cambridge, Massachusetts.
         I’m passionate about rowing and currently train with Community Rowing, Inc. (CRI) in Boston.
          Rowing has taught me discipline, perseverance, and the value of 
        teamwork—qualities I carry into all areas of my life.
         I plan to continue rowing at the Division I level in college, and even plan to take a gap year in order to get bigger and faster.
          Outside of rowing and academics, I enjoy spending time with my two siblings, as well as watching basketball and hockey.</p>
